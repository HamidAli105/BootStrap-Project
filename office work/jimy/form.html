<p>2.1 The Client is taken to have exclusively accepted and is immediately bound, jointly and severally, by these terms and conditions if the Client</p>
places an order for Goods, or accepts Delivery.</p>
<p>2.2 In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Contract and any other prior document or schedule that the parties
have entered into, the terms of this Contract shall prevail.</p>
<p>2.3 Any amendment to the terms and conditions contained in this Contract may only be amended in writing by the consent of both parties.</p>
<p>2.4 The Client acknowledges that the supply of Goods on credit shall not take effect until the Client has completed a credit application with R & S

<p>2.5 In the event that the supply of Goods requested exceeds the Client’s credit limit and/or the account exceeds the payment terms, R & S Trade

<p>2.7 Any sale that cannot be completed for any reason will be deemed cancelled and the Client will be refunded.</p>
<h3>3. Change in Control</h3>
<p>3.1 The Client shall give R & S Trade Centre not less than fourteen (14) days prior written notice of any proposed change of ownership of the Client
and/or any other change in the Client’s details (including but not limited to, changes in the Client’s name, address, contact phone or fax
number/s, or business practice). The Client shall be liable for any loss incurred by R & S Trade Centre as a result of the Client’s failure to comply

<h3>4. Price and Payment</h3>

<p>4.2 R & S Trade Centre reserves the right to change the Price:</p>
<p>(a) if a variation to the Goods which are to be supplied is requested; or</p>
<p>(b) in the event of increases to R & S Trade Centre in the cost of labour or materials, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which are
beyond R & S Trade Centre’s control.</p>
<p>4.3 Time for payment for the Goods being of the essence, the Price will be payable by the Client on the date/s determined by R & S Trade Centre,
which may be:</p>
<p>(a) on order placement; or</p>

<p>4.5 Unless otherwise stated the Price does not include GST. In addition to the Price the Client must pay to R & S Trade Centre an amount equal to
any GST R & S Trade Centre must pay for any supply by R & S Trade Centre under this Contract or any other agreement for the sale of the
Goods. The Client must pay GST, without deduction or set off of any other amounts, at the same time and on the same basis as the Client pays

expressly included in the Price.</p>
<h3>5. Description of the Goods</h3>

will not be liable to the Client in respect of Goods which comply with these standards.</p>

<p>6.1 Delivery of the Goods (“Delivery”) is taken to occur at the time that the nominated carrier delivers the Goods to the Client’s nominated address.
In the absence of the Client (or its nominated agent) from the address:</p>
<p>(a) a calling card will be left at the address, notifying the Client to contact the carrier for collection or additional Delivery (which shall be charged
at a flat fee of ten dollars ($10.00); and</p>
<p>(b) Delivery will be deemed to have been made at the time, date and place certified by the carrier.</p>
<p>6.2 At R & S Trade Centre’s sole discretion, the cost of Delivery is:</p>
<p>(a) included in the Price for the greater Christchurch area; or</p>
<p>(b) in addition to the Price for any other area.</p>
<p>6.3 The Client must take Delivery, by receipt or collection of the Goods, whenever they are tendered for Delivery. In the event that the Client is
unable to take Delivery as arranged, then R & S Trade Centre shall be entitled to charge a reasonable fee for redelivery and/or storage.</p>
<p>6.4 R & S Trade Centre may deliver the Goods in separate instalments. Each separate instalment shall be invoiced and paid in accordance with the
provisions in these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>6.5 R & S Trade Centre’s estimated time for Delivery is between three (3) to seven (7) days from confirmed receipt of the Client’s order and/or
payment, which may be increased by one (1) or two (2) days for Delivery to rural areas. However, any time or date given by R & S Trade Centre
to the Client is an estimate only. The Client must still accept Delivery even if late, and R & S Trade Centre will not be liable for any loss or
damage incurred by the Client as a result of Delivery being late.</p>

<p>7.2 If any of the Goods are damaged or destroyed following Delivery, but prior to ownership passing to the Client, R & S Trade Centre is entitled to
receive all insurance proceeds payable for the Goods. The production of these terms and conditions by R & S Trade Centre is sufficient
evidence of R & S Trade Centre’s rights to receive the insurance proceeds without the need for any person dealing with R & S Trade Centre to
make further enquiries.</p>
<p>7.3 If the Client requests that the Goods be delivered to an unattended location, then such Goods shall be left at the Client’s sole risk.</p>
<p>7.4 R & S Trade Centre is not responsible for any loss or damage to the Goods in transit. The Client must, upon identifying the loss or damage on
receipt of the Goods, lodge a claim with the carrier within twenty-four (24) hours of the date of receipt of the Goods. R & S Trade Centre will
render the Client such assistance as may be necessary to press claims on carriers, provided the Client has notified R & S Trade Centre and the
carrier in writing immediately.</p>

<p>8.2 Receipt by R & S Trade Centre of any form of payment other than cash shall not be deemed to be payment until that form of payment has been

continue.</p>
<p>8.3 It is further agreed that, until ownership of the Goods passes to the Client in accordance with clause 8.1:</p>

proceeds of any insurance in the event of the Goods being lost, damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>(c) the Client must not sell, dispose, or otherwise part with possession of the Goods other than in the ordinary course of business and for
market value. If the Client sells, disposes or parts with possession of the Goods then the Client must hold the proceeds of any such act on
trust for R & S Trade Centre and must pay or deliver the proceeds to R & S Trade Centre on demand.</p>
<p>(d) the Client should not convert or process the Goods or intermix them with other goods but if the Client does so then the Client holds the
resulting product on trust for the benefit of R & S Trade Centre and must sell, dispose of or return the resulting product to R & S Trade
Centre as it so directs.</p>
<p>(e) the Client irrevocably authorises R & S Trade Centre to enter any premises where R & S Trade Centre believes the Goods are kept and
recover possession of the Goods, without liability for trespass or and damage caused thereby.</p>
<p>(f) R & S Trade Centre may recover possession of any Goods in transit, whether or not Delivery has occurred.</p>

not passed to the Client.</p>
